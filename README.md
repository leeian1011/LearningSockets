# Simple Client-Server Program using Sockets.

## Why am I doing this manually when I can just use a web framework and get a web server up in no time?

1. I want to learn TCP and the communication layer at a lower level. Learning sockets will help improve my understanding on what is going on underneath the hood when I use frameworks.
2. I'll be able to get a better understanding of just exactly how communications work.

### Notes

1. The SimpleProtocol is used to simply understand how a server would respond to a user sending requests. Working with it has taught me that making responses for a server is no easy task.
2. I plan to recreate this in C to further improve my lower-level understanding.
